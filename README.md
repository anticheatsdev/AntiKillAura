#  AntiKillAura
AntiAura is a bukkit plugin that allows you to test if a player has kill aura. It basically sends a packet to the player that spawns a configurable number of fake players for a configurable amount of time. The message is sent to administrator with the result (how many test players were attacked).

Although tested on Spigot,  AntiKillAura should work with most forks.

AntiKillAura has an experimental support for GeyserMC even if you will get some false flags. In this case I suggest to report them.
